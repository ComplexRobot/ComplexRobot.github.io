### Development Info.
This is an input validator and data display GUI written in HTML, Javascript and CSS and hosted on github.

The data was generated externally with a brute force algorithm written in C++ and compiled with Visual Studio.

All possible 75602251018 ingredient combinations were filtered into the shortest combination (least fillings) for a particular power result using the rules explained [here](https://pastebin.com/p9XhUB0A).

Then, a secondary program sorts and filters the results which are saved as data to JSON files with a specific filename format.

The GUI does not generate anything, it simply accesses the JSON files previously generated by the C++ programs.

The C++ source code is not publicly available.
